# Flight_Fare_Predictor
A machine learning model developed to predict flight fares based on various features such as airline, source, destination, route, departure time, and duration. This project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
# Steps to run Flight Fare App - on Windows

* Prerequisites: [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (ensure Python is added to [PATH](https://medium.com/co-learning-lounge/how-to-download-install-python-on-windows-2021-44a707994013)) + [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Client 
* Open GIT CMD >> navigate to working directory >> Clone this Github Repo (or download project files from GitHub directly)

      git clone https://github.com/skillcate/flight-price-prediction.git  
* Open Windows Powershell >> navigate to new working directory (cloned repo folder)
* Run Project in Flask (Using PIP + Virtualenv)
 
        pip install virtualenv                  # install virtual environment        
        virtualenv ENV                          # create virtual environment by the name ENV
        .\ENV\Scripts\activate                  # activate ENV
        pip install -r .\requirements.txt       # install project dependencies
        python app.py                           # run the project
        deactivate                              # close virtual environment once done
